# Godwoken Polyjuice
An Ethereum compatible backend for [Godwoken](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken) (a generic optimistic rollup framework). It includes [generator](./c/generator.c) and [validator](./c/validator.c) implementations.

Polyjuice provides an [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) compatible layer on [Nervos CKB](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb). It leverages account model as well as scalability provided by [Godwoken](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken/blob/develop/docs/life_of_a_godwoken_transaction.md), then integrates [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone) as an EVM engine for running Ethereum smart contracts.

Polyjuice aims at 100% EVM compatibility as a goal, meaning we plan to support all smart contracts supported by the latest Ethereum hardfork version. See [EVM-compatible.md](docs/EVM-compatible.md) and [Addition-Features.md](docs/Addition-Features.md) for more details.

## Data Structures

### Polyjuice arguments
```
header     : [u8; 8]  (header[0]    = 0xff, 
                       header[1]    = 0xff, 
                       header[2]    = 0xff, 
                       header[3..7] = "POLY"
                       header[7]    = call_kind { 0: CALL, 3: CREATE })
gas_limit  : u64      (little endian)
gas_price  : u128     (little endian)
value      : u128     (little endian)
input_size : u32      (little endian)
input_data : [u8; input_size]   (input data)
to_address : [u8; 20] (optional) the `to` address of a native transfer transaction
```

Every Polyjuice argument fields must be serialized one by one and put into Godwoken [`RawL2Transaction.args`][rawl2tx-args] for Polyjuice to read. When the `input_data` contains 56 bytes, for contract call, the serialized data size is `8 + 8 + 16 + 16 + 4 + 56 = 108` bytes; for native token transfer, the serialized data size is `8 + 8 + 16 + 16 + 4 + 56 + 20 = 128` bytes.


### Creator account script
```
code_hash: Polyjuice_validator_type_script_hash
hash_type: type
args:
    rollup_type_hash : [u8; 32]
    sudt_id          : u32          (little endian, the token id)
    eth_addr_reg_id  : u32          (little endian, the ETH_Address_Registry Contract id)
```

Polyjuice creator account is a Godwoken account for creating Polyjuice contract account. This account can only be created by [meta contract][meta-contract], and the account id is used as the chain id in Polyjuice. The `sudt_id` field in script args is the sUDT token current Polyjuice instance bind to as [`pCKB`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken/blob/develop/docs/life_of_a_polyjuice_transaction.md#pCKB). The `eth_addr_reg_id` field in script args is the id of `ETH Address Registry` layer2 contract which provides two-ways mappings between `eth_address` and `gw_script_hash`.

### Contract account script

```
code_hash: polyjuice_validator_type_script_hash
hash_type: type
args:
    rollup_type_hash   : [u8; 32]   (the rollup type hash of the current Godwoken deployment)
    creator_account_id : u32        (little endian, it's the ID of Polyjuice Root Account)
    contract_address   : [u8; 20]   (this 20 bytes value is keccak256(info_data)[12..], and the
                                     `info_data` to be hashed depends on how the account was
                                     created: `CREATE` or `CREATE2`)
```

The `contract_address` could be calculated through 2 ways:

#### 1. Normal contract account script
The Polyjuice contract account created in Polyjuice by `CREATE` call kind or Opcode.
```
info_content:
    sender_address  : [u8; 20]   (the sender's eth_address)
    sender_nonce    : u32        (the transaction counter of the sender account)
    
info_data: rlp_encode(sender_address, sender_nonce)
```

#### 2. Create2 contract account script
The Polyjuice contract account created in Polyjuice by `CREATE2` Opcode.
```
info_data:
    special_byte    : u8         (value is '0xff', refer to Ethereum)
    sender_address  : [u8; 20]   (the sender's eth_address)
    create2_salt    : [u8; 32]   (create2 salt)
    init_code_hash  : [u8; 32]   (keccak256(init_code))
```

### EOA Address used in Polyjuice
Polyjuice only provides contract accounts. Godwoken's user account is leveraged to act as externally owned account (EOA). In the latest version of Polyjuice, the EOA address is native `eth_address`, which is the rightmost 160 bits of a Keccak hash of an ECDSA public key.
